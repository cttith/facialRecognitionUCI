Using the CMU Face Images Data Set, we trained our ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) models to predict the direction the person in the picture, the direction the person in the photo is facing, their emotion, and whether the person is wearing sunglasses or not.
Inside the CNNModels folder are the corresponding CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) models.

Usage: Run grabImageLabels.R file first, followed by processData.R, then any other file will succesfully run.
