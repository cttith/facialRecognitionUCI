Using the CMU Face Images Data Set, we trained our ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) models to correctly predict the person in the picture, the direction the person in the photo is facing, their facial expression (emotion), and whether the person is wearing sunglasses or not.
Inside the CNNModels folder are the corresponding CNN (Convolutional Neural Networks) models.

Usage: Run grabImageLabels.R file first, followed by processData.R, then any other file will succesfully run.
